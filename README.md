## ⚙️ System Description
The **oil skimmer** works on the principle of **adhesion**, where oil sticks to a rotating belt or disk and is then scraped off into a collection tank.  
The device uses **solar energy** to power an **Arduino-based control system** that drives DC motors for propulsion, steering, and oil collection.

The prototype is **controlled via Bluetooth**, allowing remote operation using a smartphone app. For future upgrades, an **ESP32 module** is planned to provide **IoT connectivity**, enabling cloud-based monitoring and autonomous control.

## 🌎 Marine Ecosystem Guardian

Oil spills pose one of the greatest threats to marine ecosystems, causing long-term damage to aquatic life, coral reefs, and coastal habitats. The IoT-Based Solar-Powered Oil Skimmer acts as a Marine Ecosystem Guardian, helping to protect and restore ocean health through sustainable technology.

By efficiently removing oil and grease from the water surface, the system:

- Prevents suffocation of fish and aquatic organisms

- Reduces toxic contamination of coral reefs and coastal zones

- Helps restore oxygen balance in marine environments

- Ensures safer conditions for birds and marine mammals

- Supports sustainable fishing and clean coastal tourism

Unlike conventional cleanup systems, this project uses solar energy and smart control mechanisms to operate continuously without adding pollution back into the environment.
It stands as a symbol of how renewable technology and IoT innovation can work together to preserve marine biodiversity and promote a cleaner, safer planet for future generations.
